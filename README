JGoff-App-Make

A pure-perl make alternative, the idea for the moment being that it does just
enough to manage installs of pure perl modules. For the moment it should be
just enough to manage the basics of 'make', 'make test' and 'make install'.

The tests will rely on a working C compiler until I can come up with a better
way to test the interactions using external utilities, so this isn't great to
install on production boxes with no compilers.

Currently it's not self-hosting, that will eventually change.

INSTALLATION

	perl Makefile.PL
